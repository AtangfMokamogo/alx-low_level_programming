## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c): This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
  
* **1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c): This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
  
* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c):
  Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  
* **3. alphABET**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c): Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
  
* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [4-print_alphabt](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c): Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  
* **5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c): Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
  
* **6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c): Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
  
* **7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c): Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
  
* **8. Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c): Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  
* **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c): Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
  
* **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c): Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
  
* **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
  * [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c): Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
  
* **12. Software is eating the World**
  * [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/AtangfMokamogo/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c): Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
